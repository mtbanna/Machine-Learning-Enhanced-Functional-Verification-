# Machine Learning Enhanced Functional Verification 
 This repo contains my graduation project files. It mainly consists of 2 parts: creating a UVM environment from scratch to test ARM AMBA AHB , and enhancing the huge time consumed by testing by a machine learning model consisting of 3 different algorithms created by me.
