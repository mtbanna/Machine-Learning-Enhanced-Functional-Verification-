# Machine Learning Enhanced Functional Verification 
 This repo contains my graduation project files. It mainly consists of 2 parts: 
 -Creating a UVM environment from scratch to test ARM AMBA AHB
 -Reducing the huge time consumed from testing by a machine learning model consisting of 3 different algorithms created by me

 More intuitive information about my project can be found at the presentation.
